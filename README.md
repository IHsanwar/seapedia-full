# Overview

SEAPEDIA is a modern marketplace platform that simulates a complete e-commerce ecosystem for marine products and services.

Unlike a traditional online store, SEAPEDIA supports multiple actors within one integrated system:

-  Buyer
-  Seller
-  Driver
-  Admin

The platform implements a complete transaction lifecycle—from product browsing, shopping cart, checkout, seller processing, delivery assignment, until administrative monitoring and overdue handling.
